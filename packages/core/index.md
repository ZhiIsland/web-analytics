## Usage

It is recommended to initialize in public tool files such as utils and export the initialized instance.

```ts
// @/utils.ts
import { Analytics } from '@web-analytics/core'

// Perform initialization and export the instance
export const analytics = new Analytics({
  platform: 'example_platform',
  websiteId: 'example_website_id',
})
```

The JS-SDK file of the analytics platform will be loaded during initialization.

In other files, import the instance and call the method on the instance.

```ts
// @/foo.ts
import { analytics } from '@/utils'

const url = window.location.href
analytics.trackPageview(url)
```

For more detailed instructions, continue reading the documentation.

## Initialization

Import `Analytics` from `@web-analytics/core` with named imports into your file, and initialize it with the `new` operator.

During initialization, some options need to be passed in, see the type declarations below.

```ts
import { Analytics } from '@web-analytics/core'

const analytics = new Analytics(options)
```

- Type Declarations:

```ts
interface CreateAnalyticsInstanceOptions {
  /**
   * Provides a replacement for the plugin ID for upper-level plugins
   */
  pluginId?: string

  /**
   * The data will be submitted to the current platform
   */
  platform: SupportedAnalyticsPlatforms

  /**
   * The website id from analytics platform
   */
  websiteId: WebsiteId

  /**
   * Whether to enable debug mode
   */
  debug?: boolean
}
```

## Methods

On the initialized instance, some APIs are provided to call.

### setAccount

Provide multi-account switching for upper-level plugins.

:::tip
When calling other methods, this method will be called first to activate the website ID corresponding to the instance to ensure the correctness of data submission, so you usually donâ€˜t need to call this method.

declare function setAccount(): void
```

```ts
analytics.setAccount()
```
